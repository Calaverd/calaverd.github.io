One day I decided to do a series of tutorials on programing, because... Why not?

This series of tutorials is based on the assumption that you have some programming experience, not specifically with Lua.
If you don't know how to program, I urge you to search for programming tutorials on the internet, while using these tutorials. Learning to do something new is a process that takes time, but its rewards can be very sweet.

Do not forget, the tutorials are just a guide that presents to you the answers to a problem already solved. You are free to experiment and at the end, it depends on you being able to apply these answers as you see fit.
